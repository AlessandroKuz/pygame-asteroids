# pygame-asteroids

Welcome to `pygame-asteroids`!

This is a simple game I made in python following
the [related course on Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids-python).

Currently, the game is very simple, you just install `python`, then install the `pygame` libray requirement via:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And just run the game!
```bash
python main.py
```

## Commands

You can move the spaceship with either `WASD` or the `arrow keys`:
- `W` or `UP`: go forward
- `S` or `DOWN`: go backwards
- `A` or `LEFT`: turn left
- `D` or `RIGHT`: turn right
- And shoot with `SPACEBAR`!

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] Add a scoring system
- [ ] Implement multiple lives and respawning
- [ ] Add a background image
- [ ] Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- [ ] Add acceleration to the player movement
- [ ] Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- [ ] Create different weapon types
- [ ] Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- [ ] Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- [ ] Add a shield power-up
- [ ] Add a speed power-up
- [ ] Add bombs that can be dropped
